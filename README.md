## 🚀 Get Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

### 2. Run the App Locally (Android)

Ensure your Android emulator is running or connect a device via USB

```
npm run build
```

Alternatively to open the project in development mode

```
npm run start
```

### 3. Troubleshooting

If you hit environment or dependency issues:

```
npx expo-doctor
```

### ⚙️ Requirements

Node.js 18 or 20

Android Studio with emulator configured (for Android builds)

Java 17 installed and available on your PATH

Expo CLI (bundled via npx expo)

### 🛠 Additional Notes

Native android/ folder is included for local Android builds

Charts use react-native-skia, requiring native builds — not supported in Expo Go

For iOS development, future setup for Xcode is required
